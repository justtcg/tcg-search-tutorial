### ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Notice

This project makes API calls directly from client-side JavaScript **for demonstration purposes only**.

This is **not a secure practice for production applications** because it exposes your API key to anyone viewing the browser's source code. In a real-world application, you should proxy your API requests through a secure backend server where your API key can be stored safely as an environment variable.
